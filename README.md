# event-graphql-backend

A graphql backend template project.   
Using nodemon, mongoose, express and MongoDB. Model, Schema, Resolver and API ready. JWT token authentication ready.   
 You are welcome to use it as a graphql backend template.
Don't forget to checkout my event-react-native project to achieve a comprehensive frontend+backend project.

Inspired by Acedemind Youtube channel. Checkout their awesome videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7giZGFDGnkc&list=PL55RiY5tL51rG1x02Yyj93iypUuHYXcB_  
You might notice my version is quite differen from Acedemind's version. This is because I code in a up to date style while their videos are made in 2019 and their graphql version compare to nowaday is quite different.
My optimisation is still in progress though.

You might want to register your own remote MongoDB from here. https://www.mongodb.com/.  
Update the app.js & nodemon.json file so that you can connect this backend to the remote database.
